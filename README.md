# Single-Vote-Enforcement-System
Problem Statement<br>
Our project is to develop a PHP-based single vote enforcement system aimed at stream- 
lining the election process. This project involves user registration, validation, and gen- 
eration of unique QR-coded voter ID cards. On election day, voters’ QR codes are 
scanned at polling stations for verification, allowing the generation of the respective 
ballot paper. Post-voting, QR codes are deactivated until the subsequent elections, 
ensuring integrity and preventing duplicate votes. 
 
Objective<br> 
• Develop a Secure Voter Registration System.<br>
• Ensure Eligibility and Security.<br> 
• Provide a Seamless Voting Experience.<br> 
• Prevent Unauthorized Usage.<br>
• Facilitate Secure Reporting of Election Results.<br> 
 
Scope<br>
• Development of a secure online platform for voter registration.<br> 
• Design of a controlled and monitored QR code activation process at polling sta- 
tions.<br> 
• Secure collection and reporting of election results.<br> 
• The project aims to create a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly voting system 
that enhances the integrity of elections and ensures a seamless and trust- worthy 
experience for voters.<br>
